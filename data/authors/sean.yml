name: Sean Parrott-Wolfe
description: I began altering AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files in MSDOS and writing programs in QBasic thirty years ago. The web was still in its infancy. In my early teens, I took up locksmithing and lockpicking. In college I studied cryptography. Since then, I have strived to learn and continually develop new skills within the security realm. I have primarily focused on Windows networks and Active Directory, applied cryptography and cryptanalysis, open-source intelligence, and physical security.
