In an increasingly digital world, the security of your systems, data, and operations isn't just a concernâ€”it's a business imperative. Cybersecurity isn't merely about "firewalls" and "antivirus software." It's about protecting your reputation, your intellectual property, your clients, and your future. 

My name is Sean, and I specialize in fortifying the foundations of businesses through a holistic, strategic approach to cybersecurity. Think of me as your personal cyber bodyguard, with the skills, tools, and knowledge to ward off the digital wolves at the gate.
