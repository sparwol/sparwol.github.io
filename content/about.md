Sparwol is a private information security and cybersecurity consultant offering a variety of security services to small businesses. 'Why small businesses?' you might ask. The answer is simple: Small businesses are more affected by attacks. 

Small to mid-sized businesses are increasingly the victims of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/43-of-cyberattacks-target-small-businesses-300729384.html">cyber attacks</a> because typically they are easier targets. However, with the right planning and education, businesses of any size can be properly prepared to minimizing risk, and protect their most-valued business-critical assets.
