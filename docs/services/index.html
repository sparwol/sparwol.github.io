		<div><p>In order to effectively address a client&rsquo;s security needs, a whole-picture view is required. Which assets are most valuable or most important to protect? Where is the weakest link and how secure is it? How well are employees trained and educated? These are critical questions that must be asked. I provide a range of security consulting services to small businesses. The utmost care is taken with all our work. The main streams of work we perform are as follows:</p>
		<h3 id="pentest">Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessments</h3>
		<p> don't play by the rules, so why should you? By simulating real-world attacks, I help identify vulnerabilities before the bad guys do. From internal and external networks to web applications, IoT devices, and cloud environments, I use industry-leading tools and tactics to expose weaknesses and provide actionable remediation strategies. It's like letting me rob your digital bank—only to stop me and secure your vault before anyone else even tries.
		</p>
		<h3 id="purpleteam">Purple Teaming & Threat Emulation</h3>
		<p>You don't have to wait for an attack to happen to test your defenses. Through purple teaming, I collaborate with your security team to emulate sophisticated adversaries, testing the full breadth of your security infrastructure. The goal isn't just to defend—it's to evolve, learn, and adapt, so you're always one step ahead. It's like playing chess with an invisible opponent—you won't see their moves, but you'll be prepared for any attack.
		</p>
		<h3 id="compliance">Compliance Auditing & Policy Development</h3>
		<p>Navigating the ever-changing landscape of cybersecurity regulations can be like trying to find a needle in a haystack. I help businesses meet and exceed compliance standards like HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR, ensuring your policies are not just compliant but proactive. I'll help you navigate the labyrinth of legal and regulatory requirements while crafting custom policies and procedures to suit your specific needs. Think of me as your compliance GPS—guiding you through the maze, so you don't get lost in the weeds.
		</p>
		<h3 id="training">Security Awareness Training</h3>
		<p>Your team is your first line of defense. But even the best soldiers need proper training. With interactive and engaging security awareness training, I'll ensure your employees understand the risks, best practices, and how to spot phishing emails and other social engineering attacks. It's like a fire drill for the digital world—except this one could save you a lot more than just the office coffee machine.
		</p>
		<h3 id="risk">Risk Assessment & Mitigation</h3>
		<p>Every business has its risks, but not every risk is worth mitigating the same way. I specialize in conducting thorough risk assessments to evaluate your business's most pressing vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigation efforts. I'll ensure that you allocate resources where they matter most, so you're not wasting time securing the digital equivalent of a coffee pot when your server room's front door is wide open.
		</p>
		<h3 id="incident_response">Incident Response & Crisis Management</h3>
		<p>In the event of a breach or attack, you need more than just an expert—you need someone who can lead the charge, minimize damage, and restore operations swiftly. I provide incident response services to ensure that when the inevitable happens, your business is back on its feet in no time, with minimal impact to your operations. Like a cyber paramedic, I'll stabilize your systems and get you back to business.</p>
